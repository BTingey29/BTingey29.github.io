        <h3><u>Oracle Red Bull Racing</u></h3>
        <p>Prior to officially entering as a works team in 2004,
          Red Bull had experience in Formula One as official sponsors.
          However, the extent of their achievement during the succeeding ten years was astounding.
          Following their first podium finish in 2006, the team found their groove in 2009, winning six races and
          finishing second in the constructors' standings.
          Sebastian Vettel became the sport's youngest quadruple champion for the following four seasons as they
          became a force to be reckoned with, winning consecutive title doubles between 2010 and 2013.
          A similarly promising talent, one by the name of Max Verstappen, now holds the key to their aspirations of
          reclaiming that glory.</p>

        <h3><u>Scuderia Ferrari</u></h3>
        <p>Ferrari and Formula 1 racing have, for many people, become synonymous.
          The Prancing Horse, the only team to have participated in each and every season since the world
          championship
          began,
          has evolved from the modest goal of founder Enzo Ferrari to become one of the most recognizable and
          well-known
          brands in the entire world.
          Success was achieved quickly with drivers like Alberto Ascari and John Surtees,
          and it persisted despite tougher times with Niki Lauda in the 1970s and then Michael Schumacher in
          the 2000s, when Ferrari won an unprecedented five straight championships,
          cementing their position as the most successful and decorated team in Formula One history.</p>

        <p>With the formation of a works squad for 2010, Mercedes' modern F1 rebirth got underway, serving as the
          foundation for an explosive ascent up the Grand Prix standings. With Michael Schumacher's stunning
          comeback, the team immediately generated a lot of buzz. However, the racing world soon caught wind of the
          team's success when Nico Rosberg won three podiums in their inaugural season in China in 2012. He was
          teamed with Lewis Hamilton the next season, and the two went on to stage some epic title races as the
          Silver Arrows swept everyone in their path to become one of the most powerful teams in the contemporary
          era of Formula One. And with George Russell now partnering with Hamilton, Mercedes is still the squad to
          beat.

          already won races, so their next objective must be frequent podiums and an attempt at the championship.

        <p>Since the beginning of the Formula 1 championship in 1950, the name Alfa Romeo has been associated with
          the sport. In the twenty-first century, the team formerly known as Sauber has a new era where Italian
          flair and Swiss sensibilities merge.

          Peter Sauber led his namesake team into Formula One in 1993 after enjoying tremendous success in global
          sportscars, where he assisted in developing the abilities of future F1 stars Michael Schumacher and
          Heinz-Harald Frentzen.

          Since then, the team has been a stalwart of the grid, winning races when briefly owned by BMW, and earning
          a well-deserved reputation for both building competitive vehicles and training up-and-coming drivers.</p>
